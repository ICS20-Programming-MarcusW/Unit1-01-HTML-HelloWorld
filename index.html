    <head> <h3> My favourite pastime: </h3> </head> 
      <body>  My favourite pastime is playing hockey! At the age of 5, I was introduced to the sport of hockey by my father. I wasn't a huge fan at the time, but as the years progressed, and my skill as well, I completely fell in love. It is a fantastic sport that teaches you valubale skills, and a is a great way to get in shape. It is al;so coping tool that always brings me joy when I am feeling low. Thanks to hockey, I leanred so much things like teamwork, the art of strategy, and to never back down. Moreover, it even brought me closer to my family because some of my best memories were when myself, my brothers, adn my fathers would go and play on the outdoor rink! </body>
      <head> <h3> My least favourite subject: </h3> </head>
      <body> Despite the fact that all subjects in school are extremely useful and add value to my life, some simply aren't of interest to me and for that reason, they are my least favourite. In school, my least favourite subject would have to be art. Even though I know it teaches you creativity and allows you to express yourself in different ways, I am not all that great it. Therefore, art is my least favourite subject because I find it hard to expresss myself and it doesn't spark interest in me. </body>
