          Why is travelling and exploring important to me?
      </center> </h3>
    <body> <h4>
        Travelling the world and exploring new places are both remarkable ways to try new things in life. Travelling and exploring interests me because it opens my eyes to new walks of life, introduces me to new wonderful cultures, and allows me to exit my comfort zone to experience more out of life. Moreover, it elicits me to embrace new adventures, and challenges me to interact with different humans and races that will develop me as a person. Steering apart from the fact that I will witness beautiful landscapes, I also get to embrace new cultures. I always love trying new and diverse foods, listening to foreign and beautiful music, examining others' way of life, and so much more.

            In my short but fruitful lifetime, I have had the opportunity to visit numerous stunning and breath-taking places all over the world. One of the places I have visited that means the absolute most to me is Jamaica, Ocho Rios. There is no single reason for why this place is so strongly felt in my heart, but many. One of the reasons why the trip I took to Ocho Rios has stayed with me to this day, is because of all the warm-hearted and caring people that I met there. Overall, it was a fantastic experience that I would not trade anything else in the world for.

Where do I wish to visit?

                Although I have already visited many wonders of this earth, I still hope to visit many more. Firstly, I would love to visit Lebanon. Lebanon is the birthplace of my parents and ancestors, but I have never been there. I would like to visit Lebanon to learn about my past history, and the customs in Lebanon because it is those customs that formed my culture. Secondly, I hope to one day visit Banff. Banff is one of Canada's great national treasures. From the soaring mountains, to the turqoise lakes, Banff is truly a one of a kind.
